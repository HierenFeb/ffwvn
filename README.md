After three years of effort city scientists now agree that the primary cause of the 2003 heatwave was hot air from our air conditioning units. "The study cost the city taxpayer under 10 million dollars" said Prof. Steve 'Call me Stephen' Wahoonie, of City University Public Expenditure on Science dept. "We had five top statisticians working on it: one to write the grant proposal, one to do the mathematical modelling, two to collaborate on the research paper, and one to hire a student to do the job."
